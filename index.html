      <h2> 1. Skin Cancer is a <em>Serious</em> Health Concern</h2>

      <p>Skin Cancer Prevention is critical because skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States
        of America. Protect your skin and body in order to help lower risk. There are simple yet effective ways to do so
        that will help prevent serious damage--one way is to wear sunscreen. </p>


      <h2>2. Ultraviolet (UV) Rays are the <em>Number One</em> Cause of Skin Cancer</h2>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/stay-sun-safe-this-summer.html">American Cancer
          Society</a>, over exposure to UV rays from the sun and tanning beds increases your risk of skin cancer and may
        cause long-term skin damage. <a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/preventing-cancer/sun-protection/preventing-skin-cancer/spf50sunscreen.html)">The
          Australian Cancer Council</a> cites Ultra Violet B (UVB) rays as <q>the major cause of sunburn and increased
          skin cancer risk, while Ultra Violet A (UVA) contributes to ageing of the skin, as well as higher skin cancer
          risk.</q> </p>


      <h2>3. Sunscreen is a Safe Way to Protect You From <em>UV Rays</em></h2>
      <p>A <strong>broad</strong> spectrum sunscreen with a minimum Sun Protect Factor (SPF) 15 helps prevent UV damage,
        even on cloudy days.</p>
      <!-- ul list and list items -->
      <ul>
        <li>Broad spectrum means it offers protection from longer UVA rays and shorter UVB rays. </li>
        <li>The higher the SPF, the more protection it offers from UVB rays, but you should always look for "broad
          spectrum" to get protection from UVA rays too. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>However, no sunscreen can completely block out ALL UV rays. Apply sunscreen prior to going outside everyday. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/sun-safety.htm]">The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> recommends combining sunscreen with other forms of sun protection options such as seeking
      shade and wearing a hat, sunglasses, and long-sleeved clothing.</p>

      <h2> 4. <strong>Chemical vs. Physical Sunscreens?</strong></h2>
      <p>The type of sunscreen you use depends on your skin sensitivity and how much sun exposure you are anticipating.
      <a href="https://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/sunscreens-explained">The American Skin Cancer Foundation</a> says most sunscreens offer a combination of active chemicals and physical ingredients to
      help disperse and absorb the UV rays.</p>

      <h2>5. It is best not to rely on sunscreen alone</h2>
      <p>In order to maximise protection from harmful UV Rays, limit your time spent in direct sunlight. Be proactive. Stay
      Safe and Have a Happy Summer!</p>
